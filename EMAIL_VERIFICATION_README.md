# Email Verification Implementation Guide

## Overview

This project now includes a complete email verification system that:
- Sends verification emails upon user signup
- Checks email verification status during sign-in
- Allows users to resend verification emails
- Uses Resend for reliable email delivery

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files:
1. **`src/lib/email.ts`** - Email service using Resend
2. **`src/app/api/verify-email/route.ts`** - Handles email verification from link clicks
3. **`src/app/api/resend-verification/route.ts`** - Resends verification emails
4. **`src/app/login/signin.ts`** - Sign-in logic with email verification check

### Modified Files:
1. **`prisma/schema.prisma`** - Added verification fields to User model:
   - `verificationToken: String?`
   - `verificationTokenExpiry: DateTime?`
   - `emailVerified: Boolean` (changed from DateTime to Boolean)

2. **`src/app/login/signup.ts`** - Generates tokens and sends verification emails
3. **`src/app/login/page.tsx`** - Added UI for email verification errors and resend button
4. **`.env.example`** - Added required environment variables

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the required values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required variables:
- `DATABASE_URL` - Your PostgreSQL database connection string
- `RESEND_API_KEY` - Get from https://resend.com/api-keys
- `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` - Your verified sender email (e.g., "noreply@yourdomain.com")
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` - Your app URL (e.g., "http://localhost:3000" for development)

### 2. Database Migration

Run the Prisma migration to add the verification fields:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_email_verification
```

### 3. Resend Setup

1. Sign up at https://resend.com
2. Verify your domain or use their test domain for development
3. Create an API key
4. Add the API key to your `.env` file

## How It Works

### User Signup Flow

1. User fills out signup form
2. System validates email and password
3. User account is created in database
4. Verification token is generated (cryptographically secure, 32 bytes)
5. Token and expiry (24 hours) are saved to user record
6. Verification email is sent with link containing token
7. User is shown success message

### Email Verification Flow

1. User clicks verification link in email
2. Request hits `/api/verify-email?token=xxx`
3. System validates token:
   - Checks if token exists
   - Checks if token hasn't expired
   - Checks if email isn't already verified
4. If valid, marks `emailVerified = true` and clears token
5. Redirects to login page with success message

### Sign-In Flow

1. User enters email and password
2. System validates credentials
3. **If email not verified:**
   - Shows error message
   - Displays "Resend Verification Email" button
4. **If email verified:**
   - User is signed in successfully

### Resend Verification Flow

1. User clicks "Resend Verification Email" button
2. Request sent to `/api/resend-verification`
3. New token generated with new expiry
4. New verification email sent
5. Success message displayed

## Token Security

- Tokens are generated using Node's `crypto.randomBytes(32)`
- 32 bytes = 256 bits of entropy = virtually impossible to guess
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Tokens are cleared after successful verification
- Base64URL encoding ensures URL-safe tokens

## API Endpoints

### GET /api/verify-email?token={token}
Verifies user's email address

**Query Parameters:**
- `token` (required) - Verification token from email

**Responses:**
- `302` - Redirect to login with success/error message
- `400` - Invalid or expired token
- `500` - Server error

### POST /api/resend-verification
Resends verification email

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "email": "user@example.com"
}
```

**Responses:**
- `200` - Verification email sent
- `400` - Email already verified or invalid
- `500` - Server error

## Email Template

The verification email includes:
- Branded header with gradient
- Clear call-to-action button
- Fallback link to copy/paste
- Expiry notice (24 hours)
- Security note about ignoring if not requested

## Testing

### Local Development Testing

1. Use Resend's test mode for development
2. Check email delivery in Resend dashboard
3. Test verification flow:
   ```bash
   # Start dev server
   npm run dev

   # Sign up new user
   # Check console/Resend dashboard for verification link
   # Click link to verify
   # Try signing in
   ```

### Test Cases to Verify

- [ ] Signup sends verification email
- [ ] Verification link marks email as verified
- [ ] Sign-in blocks unverified users
- [ ] Resend button generates new token
- [ ] Expired tokens are rejected
- [ ] Already verified users can't re-verify
- [ ] Invalid tokens show error message

## Troubleshooting

### Emails Not Sending

1. Check `RESEND_API_KEY` is correct
2. Verify sender email in Resend dashboard
3. Check Resend logs for errors
4. Ensure `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` is set correctly

### Token Errors

1. Check token hasn't expired (24 hours)
2. Verify database has `verificationToken` field
3. Check URL encoding of token in email

### Database Errors

1. Run migrations: `npx prisma migrate dev`
2. Regenerate Prisma client: `npx prisma generate`
3. Check `DATABASE_URL` connection

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- [ ] Add rate limiting to resend endpoint
- [ ] Customize email templates per user type
- [ ] Add email verification reminder after X days
- [ ] Implement magic link sign-in (passwordless)
- [ ] Track verification attempts for analytics
- [ ] Add SMS verification option

## Security Considerations

- Tokens are cryptographically secure (crypto.randomBytes)
- Tokens expire after 24 hours
- Rate limit resend requests (recommended)
- Don't reveal if email exists (in resend endpoint)
- Use HTTPS in production for verification links
- Clear tokens after successful verification
- Hash tokens in database for additional security (optional)

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check Resend dashboard for delivery logs
2. Review server logs for errors
3. Verify environment variables are set
4. Check database schema matches migrations
